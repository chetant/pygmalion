Here you'll find examples of integrating Pygmalion with other tools.

* `example.ycm_extra_conf.py` shows how to integrate Pygmalion with
  [YouCompleteMe](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe).

* `example.vimrc` shows how to integrate Pygmalion with `vim`. (This will
  eventually get turned into a fully-fledged plugin.)
